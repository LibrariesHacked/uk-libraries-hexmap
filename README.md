# UK Libraries Hexmap

A hexmap for library services in the UK to use in visualisations and applications

## Files

The original version (developed by Libraries Hacked) is available at `services.json`.

Since then, Open Innovations created an upper tier hexmap, available on [their layouts page](https://hexmap.uk/layouts/).

An edited version of that is included at `uk-utla-2023.hexjson`. The only changes are to change the Northern Ireland local authorities to the single Northern Ireland hexagon. This is because libraries in Northern Ireland are managed at a national level, rather than by local authorities.
